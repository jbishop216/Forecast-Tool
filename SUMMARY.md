# Employee Forecasting Tool - Project Summary

## Components Built

1. **Database Model** (`models.py`)
   - Employee, GA01Week, WorkCode, and Forecast tables
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions

2. **Database Initialization** (`init_db.py`)
   - Creates the database with initial data
   - Sets up work codes and default GA01 weeks

3. **Forecast Calculation Logic** (`forecast_calculator.py`)
   - Functions to calculate employee forecast hours
   - Handles employee type differences (FTE vs Contractor)
   - Adjusts for start/end dates and different work codes

4. **Import/Export Functionality** (`import_export.py`)
   - CSV and Excel support for importing employee data
   - Functions to import GA01 weeks data
   - Export functionality for forecast reports

5. **User Interface - PyQt6 Version** (`app.py`)
   - Complete GUI with tabbed interface
   - Tables for forecasts, employees, and GA01 weeks
   - Filtering and editing capabilities

6. **User Interface - Tkinter Version** (`app_tkinter.py`)
   - Alternative implementation using Tkinter
   - Same functionality as the PyQt version
   - More compatible with default Python installations

7. **Application Entry Point** (`main.py`)
   - Initializes the database if needed
   - Launches the application

8. **Simple Installation Checker** (`simple_app.py`)
   - Basic Tkinter app to verify installation
   - Displays instructions for required dependencies

## How to Run the Application

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas SQLAlchemy openpyxl
   ```

2. Run the main application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Features Implemented

- Forecast employee hours for a full year
- Support for different employee types (FTE and Contractor)
- Track by manager code and cost center
- Adjustable GA01 week multipliers
- Import/export functionality with CSV/Excel
- Database persistence using SQLite
- Dynamic filtering and editing

## Next Steps

1. **Dependency Resolution:**
   - Ensure pandas, SQLAlchemy, and openpyxl are installed in the correct Python environment.
   - Consider using a virtual environment for consistent dependency management.

2. **Testing:**
   - Perform thorough testing with various scenarios
   - Verify forecasting calculations across different employee types and date ranges

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Add user authentication if required
   - Implement data visualization options
   - Create backup/restore functionality
